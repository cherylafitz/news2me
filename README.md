News to Me was developed by Dave Hemmer, Mukhtar Shariff, and Cheryl FitzGerald.

###Object
The object of News to Me is to deliver information about trending topics and tweets, according to a user's selection. We created a demo "channel" highlighting the 2016 presidential candidates (those running at the time of development).

###Technologies Used
* Node.js
* Express
* npm Sentiment
* Twitter API
* D3

###Approach

###Installation Instructions

###Unsolved Problems
The sentiment analysis continues to be an experiment. It's clear that the npm sentiment module we included lacks the same kind of sophistication we use when we assess whether or not a tweet is positive. But it seems like the majority of tweets are still assessed appropriately.

###Next Steps
* Add channel categories
* Customize experience for logged-in users by only showing popular channels and channels the user created (becomes more necessary as the list of created channels increases).
