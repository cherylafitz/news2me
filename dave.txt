WDI Group Project Retrospective

CONNECTION TO MID & LONG TERM GOALS
Part of being an effective web developer is being able to communicate the work you have done and provide the rationale behind decisions that you have made. This retrospective will give you the opportunity to summarize and synthesize your projects so you can display them in your portfolio as compelling examples of your work!

RULE FOR RETROSPECTIVE
You must be objective and specific in your assessment of what happened.
Take 15 minutes to think about and write down your individual responses.
Take 30 minutes to discuss as a group, your team’s PM should facilitate the discussion.
Take 10 minutes to write down your team’s biggest takeaways, and email to your Outcomes Producer (casey@ga.co).
<<<<<<
BIGGEST TAKEAWAYS


>>>>>>
Take 5 minutes to hug it out.

LET’S GET STARTED
Think back over your process during the project and answer the following questions from, Project Retrospectives: A Handbook for Team Reviews:

-What did I do well that if I don’t record I might forget? Be specific!
-What did I learn?
-What should I do differently next time?
-What still puzzles us?

The idea is to optimize the process and team communication for your next sprint!
More retrospective questions available here.
